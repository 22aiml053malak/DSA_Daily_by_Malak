# DSA_Daily_by_Malak
This repository is my commitment to daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice until placements begin. My goal is to solve 3-5 problems daily across various topics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming to sharpen my problem-solving skills.
